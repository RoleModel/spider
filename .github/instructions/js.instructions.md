- Prefer ESM syntax for JavaScript files, and avoid using CommonJS syntax unless the file is already CommonJS.
- Important: Never use semicolons at the end of statements.
- Use single quotes for strings, except when the string contains a single quote, in which case use double quotes.
- Use `const` for variables that are not reassigned, and `let` for variables that are reassigned.

## Frameworks and Libraries
- Use [Lit](https://lit.dev/) for building web components.
