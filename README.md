# PDF Viewer 

[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js) is awesome, but you will notice this paragraph in their setup instructions:
> The viewer is built on the display layer and is the UI for PDF viewer in Firefox and the other browser extensions within the project. It can be a good starting point for building your own viewer. However, we do ask if you plan to embed the viewer in your own site, that it not just be an unmodified version. Please re-skin it or build upon it.

This component aims to be that skin layer built upon PDF.js packaged in a lovely drop-in web component.
